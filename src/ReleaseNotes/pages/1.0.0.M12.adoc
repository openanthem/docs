** Date Format changes
*** The default date display format has been changed from MM/dd/yyyy to MM/dd/yyyy HH:MM a (a indicates AM/PM).

User can configure date patterns on these fields. Since it is date formatting, the datatype of a date field whose display format needs to be 
customized has to be either LocalDate, LocalDateTime, Date, or ZonedDateTime; it cannot be a String. Example can be found
