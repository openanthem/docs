== Introduction
The Nimbus Framework supports client side validation by offering support for JSR Validation annotations, specifically from the `javax.validation.constraints` package. This includes annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Min`, `@Max`, etc.

NOTE: Only client side validation is supported today.
