= Annotation Config

The Framework offers several different means of configuration the application through Java based annotations. As seen in several of the previous examples, much of the emphasis of configuration is on decorating domain entity variables.

The most common types of annotation configs used in an application fall under the following categories:

* <<view-config-annotations>> - Instruct the UI to render a specific view component (e.g. textbox, calendar, accordion)
* <<core-config-annotations>> - Execute functional instructions or commands within the Framework
* <<config-annotations-conditional>> - Execute common functional instructions based on boolean SpEL expressions
