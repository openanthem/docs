= AccessConditional

`@AccessConditional` allows to control the access of the specific area/functionality within the application based on User's assigned role(s) and permission(s).

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@AccessConditional(whenAuthorities="?[#this == 'entity_assign'].empty", p=Permission.HIDDEN)
private Section_EntityAssignment vsEntityAssignment;
----
Above configuration would hide the entity assignment section for user(s) who do not have access to "entity_assign" action.

.AccessConditional Attributes
[cols="4,^3,^3,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
| Name 			| Type			 | Default			 | Description

| whenAuthorities			| String		 | 					 | SpEL (spring expression language) to check for user permissions **Recommended**
| whenRoles			| String		 | 					 | SpEL (spring expression language) to check for user roles
| containsAuthorites			| String[]		 | 					 | Simple contains check for user permissions. (for more complex conditions, use _whenAuthorities_)
| containsRoles			| String[]		 | 					 | Simple contains check for user roles. (for more complex conditions, use _whenRoles_)
|=========================================================

CAUTION: **_whenRoles_** and **_containsRoles_** should be used with caution, since roles may be added/changed more frequently in the application and in that event, you would need to update the entity configurations.

More Examples:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
// vbEntityCreate will be hidden for user(s) who do not have access to "entity_create"
@AccessConditional(whenAuthorities="?[#this == 'entity_create'].empty", p=Permission.HIDDEN)
private Button_EntityCreate vbEntityCreate;

//vsEntityEdit will be visible/accessible for user(s) who do not have access to "entity_create" or "entity_edit"
@AccessConditional(whenAuthorities="?[#this == 'entity_create'].empty && ?[#this == 'entity_edit'].empty", p=Permission.READ)
private Section_EntityEdit vsEntityEdit;
