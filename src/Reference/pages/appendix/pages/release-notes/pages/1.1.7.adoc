[[appendix-release-notes-1.1.7]]

Prior to this release, the release artifacts were hosted in the Anthem Inc. private Artifactory and hence were not made available to the general public. This release markes the first release that the framework has been released from the Github source code at https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core. 

The majority of work in this and the previous unofficial releases can be seen in UI support. Just a few to mention are the addition of new components such as `@InputSwitch`, `@FormElementGroup` and `@PickList`. Another big victory has been in adding support for dynamic labels and styles to params, so that users may change the labels of virtually any component under a given situation.

Numerous refactors have taken place to improve code quality and efficiency, not to mention an link:https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/openanthem/projects[A+ report card from sonarcloud.io].
