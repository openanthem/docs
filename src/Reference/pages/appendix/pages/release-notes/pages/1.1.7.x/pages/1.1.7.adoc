* **General Changes**
** Minor Bug Fixes
** Fixed an isolated issue where a core param's (collection) instantiation was not correctly updating the associated view param's leaf state
** External link support is implemented for grid row data
** Updated maven profile run-ui-tests to execute UI tests in nimbus-ui project
*** Run command: mvn clean install -P run-ui-tests

* **Core Config Annotations**
** `@Messageconditional` has support to set messages on a parameter where the stateChange or stateLoad event is not triggered
** Introduced `@StyleConditional` which works like other Conditional annotation, but applies `@Style` metadata to the targeted param based on a SpEL condition

* **View Config Annotations** 
** `@StyleConditional` was introduced to support style customization of a cell based on the state of another within `@GridColumn`
** `@Section(Type.MenuPanel)`, NavMenuGlobal is deprecated in favor of `@MenuPanel`.This annotation supports 2 parameters â€“imgSrc and imgType
** `InputLegend` which is an alternate to the html <legend> tag was introduced 
*** Accommodates dynamic text updates for legend labels. 
*** Helps in moving away from the usage of <nm-input-label> component inside <fieldset> and <legend> tags for accessible UI. 
*** Impacted nimbus components include `@Radio`, `@FormGroup` and `@CheckBoxGroup`
** AccordionTab now supports `@Form`
** Manual validation of @Form can be enabled by configuring a button as @Button(style = Button.Style.VALIDATION, cssClass = "btn btn-primary mb-1", type = Button.Type.button)
** Counter message that tracks the numberof mandatory questions left added to `@Form(showMessages=true)` and `@Accordion(showMessages=true)`
