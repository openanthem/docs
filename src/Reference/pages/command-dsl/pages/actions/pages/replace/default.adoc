[[command-dsl-actions-replace]]
= Replace

The action __replace_ sets the state of the param identified by _domain alias_ to a new state, provided as a query parameter: _rawPayload_. When using the replace action, not providing explicit values for fields will result in any existing state within the identified param to be set to `null`. In a situation where only some values of the state need to be set and the others preserved, consider using <<command-dsl-actions-update>>.

== Examples
The following class will be used in the __replace_ scenarios to follow.

[source, java]
----
@Domain("sample_entity")
@Getter @Setter
public class SampleEntity {

    private String single_element;
    private List<String> collection;
}
----

The following scenarios will also assume that the param at _sample_entity:1_ has a pre-existing state of:
[source,json]
----
{
    "single_element": "empty_value",
    "collection": ["empty_value_1"]
}
----

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing a single element state
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/single_element/_replace?rawPayload='hello'")`

.Resulting State of _sample_entity:1_
[source,json]
----
{
    "single_element": "hello",
    "collection": ["empty_value_1"]
}
----

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1/single_element`, only the field `single_element` is subject to be replaced with the `rawPayload`. The value for the field of `collection` is unaffected and retains it's previous value.

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing a collection element state
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/collection/0/_replace?rawPayload='hello'")`

.Resulting State of _sample_entity:1_
[source,json]
----
{
    "single_element": "empty_value",
    "collection": [ "hello" ]
}
----

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1/collection/0`, only the collection element having index `0` for the field `collection` is subject to be replaced with the `rawPayload`. The value for the field of `single_element` is unaffected and retains it's previous value.

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing a collection state
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/collection/_replace?rawPayload='[\"1\", \"2\"]'")`

.Resulting State of _sample_entity:1_
[source,json]
----
{
    "single_element": "empty_value",
    "collection": [ "1", "2" ]
}
----

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1/collection`, only the field `collection` is subject to be replaced with the `rawPayload`. The value for the field of `single_element` is unaffected and retains it's previous value.

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing a complex object
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/_replace?rawPayload='{\"single_element\": \"hello\"}'")`

.Resulting State of _sample_entity:1_
[source,json]
----
{
    "single_element": "hello"
}
----

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1`, both fields are subject to be replaced with the `rawPayload`. In this scenario, only `single_element` has been provided which results in `collection` having a `null` value.

NOTE: The important thing to note in this scenario, is that like all other scenarios the existing state is replaced. This means that if _collection_ of the entity located at _sample_entity:1_ had an existing value, it will be set to  `null` since the _rawPayload_ parameter did not explicitely set it.

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing an entity state with the value of another entity state
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/single_element/_replace?rawPayload=<!json(PATH_TO_PARAM)!>)`

where `PATH_TO_PARAM` is path which points to another param, relative to the location of `single_element`.

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1/single_element`, only the field `single_element` is subject to be replaced with the `rawPayload`. The value to be set will be the same as the state of the object identified by `PATH_TO_PARAM`.

TIP: This scenario can be used to copy a param's state from one param to another.

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing an entity state with post data
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/single_element/_replace")`

.Post Data
"hello"

.Resulting State of _sample_entity:1_
[source,json]
----
{
    "single_element": "hello",
    "collection": ["empty_value_1"]
}
----

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1/single_element`, only the field `single_element` is subject to be replaced with the HTTP post data. The value for the field of `collection` is unaffected and retains it's previous value.

---

[discrete]
=== Replacing an entity state to null
`@Config(url = "sample_entity:1/single_element/_replace)`

* Assumes post data is not present

.Resulting State of _sample_entity:1_
[source,json]
----
{
    "collection": ["empty_value_1"]
}
----

As the path in this scenario is pointing to `sample_entity:1/single_element`, only the field `single_element` is subject to be replaced with the HTTP post data. In this case the post data is `null` so the resulting value for `single_element` will then be `null`. The value for the field of `collection` is unaffected and retains it's previous value.
