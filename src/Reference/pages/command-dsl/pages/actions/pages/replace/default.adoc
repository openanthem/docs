[[command-dsl-actions-replace]]
= _replace

The action `_replace` sets the state of the param identified by the _domain alias_ in the <<param-pathing>> to a given state. The state to set can be provided in the following manners:

* provided as a JSON object in the HTTP POST Body
* provided as a JSON query parameter: _rawPayload_ 

In each of these scenarios, the provided JSON should conform to the object identified by the <<param-pathing>>.

When using the `_replace` action, not providing explicit values for fields will result in any existing state within the identified param to be set to `null`. In a situation where only some values of the state need to be set and the others preserved, consider using <<command-dsl-actions-update>>.

NOTE: See <<examples-action-replace>> for examples using `_replace`.
