[[command-dsl-actions-update]]
= _update

The action `_update` sets individual fields of the state of the param identified by _domain alias_ in the <<param-pathing>> to the fields of a given state.

* provided as a JSON object in the HTTP POST Body
* provided as a JSON query parameter: _rawPayload_ 

In each of these scenarios, the provided JSON should conform to the object identified by the <<param-pathing>>.

When using the update action, not providing explicit values for fields will result in any existing state within the identified param to be preserved. In a situation where only the state needs to be explicitly set, consider using <<command-dsl-actions-replace>>.

NOTE: See <<examples-action-update>> for examples using `_update`.
