= Defining a View

The UI Framework expects a specific pattern in terms of where components are placed. Each of the <<view-config-annotations>> has explicitely defined which components are to be placed where.

The same is true for setting up the standard page view. The following configuration is a typical view configuration to get started:

.Sample View Entity 1
[source,java]
----
@Domain(value="sample_view1", includeListeners = { ListenerType.websocket })
@Repo(Database.rep_none)
public class VRSampleView1 {

    @Page
    private VPMain vpMain;

    @Model @Getter @Setter
    public static class VPMain {

        @Tile
        private VTMain vtMain;
    }

    @Model @Getter @Setter
    public static class VTMain {
        
        @Section
        private VSMain vsMain;
    }

    @Model @Getter @Setter
    public static class VSMain {

        // Components here...
    }
}
----

As mentioned, this is the standard view config which can be expanded upon for an application's specific needs. The primary point to note is the structure of *Domain Entity* > *Page* > *Tile* > *Section*. Only once this structure has been defined will. For more specific information on what components can go where, please review the <<view-config-annotations>> section.
