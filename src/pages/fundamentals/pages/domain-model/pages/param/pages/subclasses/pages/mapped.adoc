= Mapped Param

A mapped param is a `Param` instance who's entity definition has been annotated with `@MapsTo.Type`. A mapped param is represented by the interface `MappedParam`.

The variable `mappedEntity` in the `SampleEntity.java` domain entity would be constructed by the Framework as a `MappedParam`.

For more information about mapped params and their behaviors, see <<configuration-mapping>>.
