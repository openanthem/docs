= Writing view configuration
This section is intended to explain detailed concepts of writing view configuration. At it's core, view configuration is nothing but a <<domain-model, domain entity>>... just another object that is provided for the framework to create and manage. The only difference is that it has additional configurative decorators that define behaviors (such as how the UI should render the final view component).

[NOTE]
When reading this chapter, please note that explicit details for how an individual view configuration annotation is used can be found in the API or in the <<view-config-annotations, Appendix>>. This chapter is more dedicated to common scenarios and larger concepts that need to be explained when writing view configuration.
