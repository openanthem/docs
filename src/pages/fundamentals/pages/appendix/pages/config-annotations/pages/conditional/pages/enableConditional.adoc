= EnableConditional

`@EnableConditional` is an extension capability provided by the framework. The annotation is used to conditionally activate/deactivate the param based on a SpEL condition. This annotation can be triggered for multiple events. Framework provides default event handling for this annotation on StateChange and StateLoad.
The difference between this annotation and `@ActivateConditional` is this annotation only affects the "enabled" state whereas `@ActivateConditional` affects both "enabled" and "visible" state.
