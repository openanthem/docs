= Chart

Chart renders a visually appealing graph/chart based on an open source HTML5 based charting library: Charts.js

.Allowed Parent Components
<<view-config-annotation-section>>

.Allowed Children Components
None. `@Chart` should decorate a field having a collection with type `DataGroup` (e.g. `List<DataGroup>`.)

.Allowed Chart Types
* Line
* Bar
* Pie
* Doughnut

.Attributes
* `xAxisLabel` = ``
** Applicable only for cartesian graphs and denotes the label to be shown for X-axis
* `yAxisLabel` = ``
** Applicable only for cartesian graphs and denotes the label to be shown for Y-axis
* `stepSize` = ``
** Applicable only for cartesian graphs and denotes the incrments of the Y-axis. If not given, the size would be random based on the Y-axis values supplied to the graph

.Sample Configuration
----
@Label("Bar Graph")
@Chart(value=Type.BAR, xAxisLabel="Domain", yAxisLabel="Count")
private List<DataGroup> barGraph;

@Label("Line Graph")
@Chart(value=Type.LINE, xAxisLabel="Domain", yAxisLabel="Count")
private List<DataGroup> lineGraph;

@Label("Pie Graph")
@Chart(value=Type.PIE)
private List<DataGroup> pieGraph;
    
@Label("Doughnut Chart")
@Chart(value=Type.DOUGHNUT)
private List<DataGroup> doughnutGraph;
----


== Data Type of Chart
Every chart that is configured with a datatype as `List<DataGroup>`. In a chart there could be 1 or more graphs that can be plotted. Each `DataGroup` qualifies to be painted as a graph. A `DataGroup` has a `legend` that indicates what the graph is and has a list of x,y co-ordinates.

If line graph configured above has the following dataset provided to the UI - 

[source, json]
[
    {
        "legend": "Region 1"
        "datapoints": [
            {1,1},{2,2},{3,3}
        ]``
    }
    {
        "legend": "Region 2"
        "datapoints": [
            {10,10},{20,20},{30,30}
        ]
    }
]

There would be 2 line graphs rendered on the page, one for Region 1 and the other for Region 2.
