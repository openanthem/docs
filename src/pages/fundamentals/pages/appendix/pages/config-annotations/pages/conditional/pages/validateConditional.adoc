= ValidateConditional

`@ValidateConditional` is used to conditionally set validations that should appear for a param based on a _SpEL_ condition. This 
annotation can be triggered for multiple conditions, if necessary. 

The logic for `@ValidateConditional` can be found in `ValidateConditionalStateEventHandler`. The handler logic will be executed during the following framework events: 

* OnStateLoad
* OnStateChange

.Configuring Conditional by Group
`@ValidateConditional` works by first evaluating the `when` attribute by means of a _SpEL_ condition. When the `when` condition is `true`, the 
framework will attempt to identify a subset of params with Validation constraints and apply validation logic to those params. See the 
following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.ValidateConditional Sample 1
----
@ValidateConditional(when = "state == 'dog'", targetGroup = GROUP_1.class)
@TextBox(postEventOnChange = true)
private String petType;

@NotNull
@TextBox
private String petName;

@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_1.class })
@TextBox
private String dogFood;

@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_2.class })
@TextBox
private String catFood;
----

====
.ValidateConditional Sample 1 - Results
In the above example, assuming the state of `petType` is `"dog"`, the validations that will be applied are: `petName` and `dogFood`.

* `petName` - There are no groups associated with `petName`, hence it is seen as a _static validation_ and always applied.
* `dogFood` - `GROUP_1.class` is present within the `@NotNull`'s `groups` attribute, and this is matching `petType`'s 
`@ValidateConditional`'s `targetGroup` attribute(`GROUP_1.class`) and is applied.

The validations that will not be applied are: `catFood`.

* _catFood_ - While _catFood_ has an entry in `@NotNull`'s `groups` attribute(`GROUP_2.class`), it is not matching `@ValidateConditional`'s 
`targetGroup` attribute(`GROUP_1.class`).

.Specifying a Validation Group
As seen in the previous example, there may be many params decorated with _javax.validation.constraints_. The framework needs to uniquely 
identify which validations should be applied when the `when` condition is *true*. To handle this, the `groups` attribute will be used as
it is supplied by of all _javax.validation.constraints_ annotation classes. The final subset of params where validations will be applied 
will be composed of only those whos `groups` attribute contains the `@ValidateConditional` `targetGroup` attribute.

`@ValidateConditional`'s `targetGroup` parameter is simply a marker interface of type `ValidationGroup` to be used for identification 
purposes by the framework to identify the subset of params.

[NOTE]
====
Use link:_validateconditionals[`@ValidateConditionals`] when:

* Different groups should be applied based on multiple _when_ conditions
* Multiple groups should be applied for the same _when_ condition
====

.Validation Group Identity Classes
In the previous example, we used `targetGroup = GROUP_1.class`. `GROUP_1.class` is an identity class that implements the 
`ValidationGroup` interface and is used by the framework to identify _javax.validation.constraints_ annotatons that should be applied. 

Any implementation that implements the _ValidationGroup_ interface may be used as a group identity class. For convenience, a set of 
identify class implementations have been defined within `@ValidateConditional` as `GROUP_**X**.class`, where 0 \<= *X* \<= 29.

[NOTE]
If additional marker classes are needed, simply create a new implementation of `ValidationGroup` and use that class in the `targetGroup` 
attribute as well as the corresponding param's _javax.validation.constraints_ annotation.

.Controlling Scope
The framework has provides the ability to define a `ValidationScope` as part of `@ValidateConditional`'s `scope` to provide control over which params should be considered for conditional validation. The following scopes are available:

.@ValidateConditional Scopes
[cols="3, 10", options="header"]
|=========================================================
| Name 				| Description

| **SIBLING**			| Applies validations to sibling params relative to the target param.
| **CHILDREN**		    | Applies validations to children params relative to the target param. 
|=========================================================

[NOTE]
Scopes are recursive in that all nested params underneath params located in the scopes identified above would also have conditional validations applied.

.Specifying Target Path
There may be a need to apply conditional validations to one or many different paths based on some `when` condition decorating a single param. The attribute `targetPath` can be used to target one or more paths to apply conditional validation to when a corresponding `when` condition is `true`. Consider the scenario below:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Model @Getter @Setter 
public static class Section1 {

	@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_1.class })
	@Calendar
	private String dateOfBirth;

	...
}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Model @Getter @Setter 
public static class Section2 {

	@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_1.class })
	@Calendar
	private String neuterDate;

	...
}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ValidateConditional(when = "state == 'dog'", targetGroup = GROUP_1.class, targetPath = { "../section1", "../section2" }, scope = ValidationScope.CHILDREN)
@TextBox(postEventOnChange = true)
private String petType;

private Section1 section1;

private Section2 section2;
----

In this scenario, the configuration for `petType` mandates that both `section1` and `section2` would be targetted and all children params of these sections (recursive) would have conditional validation applied if `GROUP_1.class` is present on the `Constraint` annotation.

In this case, both `dateOfBirth` and `neuterDate` would have conditional validation applied.

[NOTE]
Similar behavior could have been achieved by omitting the `targetPath` attribute and using `ValidationScope.SIBLING`. This was simply an example to portrait the flexibility of `targetPath` and `scope`.
