[[core-config-annotation-model]]
= Model

`@Model` is a marker annotation for the framework to acknoledge an class declaration as a _model_ entity. Useful when created "nested entities".

Model is similar to <<core-config-annotation-domain>>, except that domain is seen as the "root" entity, or the topmost parent in a nested entity. Typically, model is expected to be used on nested class declarations. See the following example: 

[source,java]
.Parent.java
----
@Domain("parent")
@Getter @Setter @ToString
public class Parent {

    private Child1 child;
}
----

[source,java]
.Child1.java
----
@Model
@Getter @Setter @ToString
public class Child1 {

    private Child2 child;
}
----

[source,java]
.Child2.java
----
@Model
@Getter @Setter @ToString
public class Child2 {

}
----

In this example, the object hierarchy is `Parent` > `Child1` > `Child2`, where `Child1` and `Child2` are decorated with `@Modal`.
