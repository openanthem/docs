= ParamContext

**@ParamContext** is used to set the contextual properties of a field during the _OnStateLoad_ event (e.g. _visible_, _enabled_).

The intent of **@ParamContext** is to be able to decorate fields to define default contextual behavior. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.SampleView.java
----
 public static class SampleView {

    @TextBox
    @ParamContext(enabled=false, visible=false)
    private String myTextBox;
 }
----

In this scenario we have configured the contextual values for _enabled_ and _visible_ to be **false** for _myTextBox_. These values will
be set during the _OnStateLoad_ event and _myTextBox_ consequently will not be enabled or visible when the corresponding page is rendered.

TIP: **@ParamContext** can also be defined on annotations. In these scenarios when a field is decorated with that annotation, then the
handler for **@ParamContext** will execute. This may be useful when building a framework extension.
