= State Event Handlers

The role of a _State Event Handler_ is to instruct the framework on how to process a conditional annotation. Therefore, it is responsible 
for maintaining the logic to be applied when a conditional annotation is present on a param. _State Event Handlers_ are registered with 
the framework through the use of `@EventHandler` on startup as Spring beans. The logic is then executed during specific event hooks 
defined within the framework.
