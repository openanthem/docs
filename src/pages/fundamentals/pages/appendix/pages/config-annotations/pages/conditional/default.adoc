= Conditional Config Annotations

This section covers the _conditional behavior_ that can be applied to params. In this context, _conditional behavior_ refers to 
performing a set of actions based on a given condition. The condition is evaluated by using the powerful capabilities of _SpEL 
(Spring Expression Language)_. 

Typically this _conditional behavior_ is evaluated from the context of the _conditionally decorated param_ (the param that is annotated 
with a conditional annotation), meaning that the condition will inspect the _decorated param_ object to infer if the condition 
should be `true` or `false`.

The following example shows what a conditional configuration might look like:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@SampleConditional(when = "state == 'YES'")
@Radio(postEventOnChange = true)
@Values(YesNo.class)
private String question;
----

The `when` condition is effectively stating, when `question.getState().equals("YES")`. In this case, since `question` is the _decorated 
param_, we are evaluating from the context of `question`. This is why `state` is understood in the _SpEL_ condition `state == 'YES'`. 

NOTE: In this scenario `@SampleConditional` is not a real annotation understood by the framework, but it illustrates the idea that when 
this particular _condition_ is `true`, we should perform some sort of behavior. We defer that logic to _State Event Handlers_.
