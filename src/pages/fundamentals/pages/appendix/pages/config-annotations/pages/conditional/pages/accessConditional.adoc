= AccessConditional

`@AccessConditional` allows to control the access of the specific area/functionality within the application based on User's assigned role(s) and permission(s).

The logic for `@AccessConditional` can be found in `AccessConditionalStateEventHandler`. The handler logic will be executed during the following framework events: 

* OnStateLoad

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@AccessConditional(whenAuthorities="?[#this == 'entity_assign'].empty", p=Permission.HIDDEN)
private Section_EntityAssignment vsEntityAssignment;
----
Above configuration would hide the entity assignment section for user(s) who do not have access to "entity_assign" action.
