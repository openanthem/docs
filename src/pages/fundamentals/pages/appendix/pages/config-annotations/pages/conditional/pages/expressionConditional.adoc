= ExpressionConditional

`@ExpressionConditional` is a very versatile conditional annotation that can be used to apply any logic that is able 
to be crafted using _SpEL_ expressions.

The logic for `@ExpressionConditional` can be found in `ExpressionConditionalStateEventHandler`. The handler logic will be executed during the following framework events: 

* OnStateLoad
* OnStateChange

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@ExpressionConditional(when="null == state && onLoad()", then="setState(T(java.time.LocalDate).now())")
private LocalDate initDateOnLoad;
----

CAUTION: The observant will notice that `@ExpressionConditional` is versatile in that it could be used to perform the 
same logic achieved by several other framework defined _conditional annotations_. Ideally it should not be used when 
another _conditional annotation_ is available to achieve the same behavor.
