= 1.3.1

The 1.3.1 version of the Nimbus Framework mostly notably incorporates UI performance related changes that were introduced in `1.1.14` and better server-side exception logging. A relatively small number of UI related bugfixes have been added. A very small number of minor UI enhancements have also been added, including `@Grid` inline add/edit and the ability to add a "default" item to `@ComboBox` list of values.
