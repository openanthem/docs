= 1.1.11
Version 1.1.11 is a very minor release that introduces just a few client required bugfixes.

Support for multi-select header checkbox to select all records in the dataset for client side paginated grids (including all pages in a paginated datatable) and also retain the individual record selection across pages. Introducing a new attribute `headerCheckboxToggleAllPages` in @Grid annotation to support the behavior.

Support for cross domain path resolver.
