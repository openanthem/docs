* **General Changes**
** link:#APIMetricLogging.adoc[APIMetricLogging]
*** @EnableAPIMetricCollection has been introduced to provide its decorated class with method level logging mechanism with log entries for method - *entry*, *exit*, *arguments* and *response*. It can be configured with log level of _info_ or _debug_ for arguments and response. By Default, the logging level for arguments & response is _debug_ and _info_ for entry and exit. Also, method exit logs the execution time of the method in milliseconds. 

*** Client applications can annotate the custom config beans with @EnableAPIMetricCollection to enable a similar logging mechanism.

** UI Logging
*** All the network calls to server which originate from the browser by user action or component loading are captured as logs and published onto a node server. This logging mechanism acts as a story board for the actions a user performs on the application. Each log entry will be in json format and captures - _appVersion_, _browserVendor_, _level_, _message_, _sessionID_, _timestamp_.
