= 1.3.2.M1

* **General Changes**
** Technical debt and cosmetic features https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/516[#516]
*** Added a "NIMBUS" Banner to the startup logs
*** Muted xerces warnings on startup
*** Cleaned up unused ViewConfig annotations and added more Javadocs for some annotations
** Refactored the conditional annotation support classes for cleaner code and better extensible support https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/561[#561]
*** `@LabelConditional`, `@StyleConditional`, `@ValuesConditional` now accept `targetPath` as a `String[]` (previously was `String`).
*** Added trace logging to monitor evaluation logic for `com.antheminc.oss.nimbus.domain.model.state.extension` classes.
*** Enhanced server-side error log messages


* **Core Changes**
** New function handler: Filter
*** Added a Filter function handler for collection/array typed parameters. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/438[#438]

* **View Config Annotations**
** `@ValidationRule`
*** ValidationRule adds support for evaluating some client side rules. This feature is currently in an experimental state. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/557[#557]

* **Performance Enhancements**
** `staticCodeValues` are now retrieved directly from the lookup function handler via `staticcodevalues` Spring cache abstraction instead of executing a `@Config` execution. This should boost performance by decreasing the amount of processing when many values are being retrieved from a lookup function handler invocation https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/567[#567], https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/583[#583]

* **Bug Fixes**
** Fixed an issue where adding entries in `@PickList` was adding only one entry https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/562[#562]
** Fixed an issue where the `@PickList` filter was not working when a previous state existed https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/563[#563]
** Fixed an issue in `@Grid` where the "Select all" functionality was not working correctly in serverside-pagination mode https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/565[#565]
** Fixed an issue in `@Grid` where using filter with ZonedDateTime did not work using `<!filterCriteria!>` https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/568[#568]
** Fixed an issue where `@Audit` was not working correctly for `@CheckBoxGroup` https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/578[#578]
** Fixed an issue where ParamStateHolder was being wrapped around a Param more than once in some annotation handlers. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/561[#561]
** Fixed an issue where `@FileUpload` was retaining the uploaded file when navigating to different pages. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/584[#584]
** Fixed an issue where date fields were inconsistent based on difference between server and browser time zone. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/issues/585[#585]
