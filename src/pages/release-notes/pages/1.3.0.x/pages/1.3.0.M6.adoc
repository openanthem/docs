= 1.3.0.M6

* General Changes
** Breadcrumb
*** The rendered breadcrumb now renders multiple levels (the previous implementation was a two-level breadcrumb, with only the home and active page). Beyond the home breadcrumb, each level of the breadcrumb represents the visited page in the visited view domain. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/499[#499], https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/534[#534]

* **View Config Annotations**
** `@Link`
*** Added configuration and UI support for navigating to external web pages using `@Config` and the default `_nav` action executor. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/474[#474]

* **Bug Fixes**
** Fixed an issue where all grid rows were being highlighted while filtering https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/490[#490]
** Fixed a regression bug `@GridColumn` element text was not wrapping https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/526[#526]
** Fixed an issue where `@Picklist` was giving a UI console error https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/533[#533], https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/commit/49d2d6907b6c3a4f00b1c24830cd05886b4ce1dc[49d2d6907]
** Fixed an issue where using `projection.mapsTo` with the **Search By Lookup** function handler was always sending the `ParamValue` object as `String` for the `code` attribute. The type is now equivalent to the mapped field. https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/536[#536]
