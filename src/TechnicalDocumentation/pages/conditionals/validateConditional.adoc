`@ValidateConditional` is used to conditionally set validations that should appear for a param based on a _SpEL_ condition. This 
annotation can be triggered for multiple conditions, if necessary. 

The framework provides default event handling for this annotation on StateChange.

.ValidateConditional Attributes
[cols="4,^3,^3,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
| Name 			| Type			 					| Default					| Description

| scope			| ValidationScope					| ValidationScope.SIBLING	| The scope for the param layer at which validations will be applied
| targetGroup	| Class<? extends ValidationGroup>	|							| Specifies which validation group should be applied
| when			| String							| 							| Configures whether or not the first truthy condition should be exclusive. If true, then only the first truthy condition will be executed. If false then all truthy conditions will be executed. the default value is true.
|=========================================================

.Configuring Conditional by Group
`@ValidateConditional` works by first evaluating the `when` attribute by means of a _SpEL_ condition. When the `when` condition is `true`, the 
framework will attempt to identify a subset of params with Validation constraints and apply validation logic to those params. See the 
following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.ValidateConditional Sample 1
----
@ValidateConditional(when = "state == 'dog'", targetGroup = GROUP_1.class)
@TextBox(postEventOnChange = true)
private String petType;

@NotNull
@TextBox
private String petName;

@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_1.class })
@TextBox
private String dogFood;

@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_2.class })
@TextBox
private String catFood;
----

====
.ValidateConditional Sample 1 - Results
In the above example, assuming the state of `petType` is `"dog"`, the validations that will be applied are: `petName` and `dogFood`.

* `petName` - There are no groups associated with `petName`, hence it is seen as a _static validation_ and always applied.
* `dogFood` - `GROUP_1.class` is present within the `@NotNull`'s `groups` attribute, and this is matching `petType`'s 
`@ValidateConditional`'s `targetGroup` attribute(`GROUP_1.class`) and is applied.

The validations that will not be applied are: `catFood`.

* _catFood_ - While _catFood_ has an entry in `@NotNull`'s `groups` attribute(`GROUP_2.class`), it is not matching `@ValidateConditional`'s 
`targetGroup` attribute(`GROUP_1.class`).
====

.Specifying a Validation Group
As seen in the previous example, there may be many params decorated with _javax.validation.constraints_. The framework needs to uniquely 
identify which validations should be applied when the `when` condition is *true*. To handle this, the `groups` attribute will be used as
it is supplied by of all _javax.validation.constraints_ annotation classes. The final subset of params where validations will be applied 
will be composed of only those whos `groups` attribute contains the `@ValidateConditional` `targetGroup` attribute.

`@ValidateConditional`'s `targetGroup` parameter is simply a marker interface of type `ValidationGroup` to be used for identification 
purposes by the framework to identify the subset of params.

[NOTE]
====
Use link:_validateconditionals[`@ValidateConditionals`] when:

* Different groups should be applied based on multiple _when_ conditions
* Multiple groups should be applied for the same _when_ condition
====

.Validation Group Identity Classes
In the previous example, we used `targetGroup = GROUP_1.class`. `GROUP_1.class` is an identity class that implements the 
`ValidationGroup` interface and is used by the framework to identify _javax.validation.constraints_ annotatons that should be applied. 

Any implementation that implements the _ValidationGroup_ interface may be used as a group identity class. For convenience, a set of 
identify class implementations have been defined within `@ValidateConditional` as `GROUP_**X**.class`, where 0 \<= *X* \<= 29.

[NOTE]
If additional marker classes are needed, simply create a new implementation of `ValidationGroup` and use that class in the `targetGroup` 
attribute as well as the corresponding param's _javax.validation.constraints_ annotation.

.Controlling Scope
Given that the framework uses `groups` to identify which params should have validations applied, it needs a way to also limit the number
of params that will be considered during the processing phase. For example, should a `@ValidateConditional` trigger **all** defined params
in the application that have a particular `targetGroup`? While necessary, such an operation may be costly.

The framework has provided the ability to define a `ValidationScope` as part of `@ValidateConditional`'s `scope` to provide control over 
these scenarios. The following scopes are available:

.@ValidateConditional Scopes
[cols="3, 10", options="header"]
|=========================================================
| Name 				| Description

| **SIBLING**			| Applies validations to sibling params relative to the current param on which this annotation is defined.
| **SIBLING_NESTED**	| Applies validations to sibling params relative to the current param on which this annotation is defined. 
						  Also recursively traverses each of the previous param's nested params (or children) and applies validations.
