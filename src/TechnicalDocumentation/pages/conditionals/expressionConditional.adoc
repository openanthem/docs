`@ExpressionConditional` is a very versatile conditional annotation that can be used to apply any logic that is able 
to be crafted using _SpEL_ expressions.

The framework provides default event handling for this annotation during the events: 

* OnStateLoad
* OnStateChange

.ExpressionConditional Attributes
[cols="4,^3,^3,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
| Name 			| Type			| Default		| Description

| then			| String	    | 				| SpEL based condition to be evaluated relative to param's state when the _when_ attribute evaluates to _true_.
| when			| String		| 				| SpEL based condition to be evaluated relative to param's state on which this annotation is declared.
|=========================================================

.Configuring @ExpressionConditional
`@ExpressionConditional` works by first evaluating the `when` attribute by means of a _SpEL_ condition. When the `when` condition is `true`, the 
framework will next execute the _SpEL_ expression contained in the `then` attribute.

Consider the following example where we conditionally set the state on load:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@ExpressionConditional(when="null == state && onLoad()", then="setState(T(java.time.LocalDate).now())")
private LocalDate initDateOnLoad;
----

Recall that the `when` expression is evaluated from the context of the param that `@ExpressionConditional` 
decorates (`initDateOnLoad`). In this scenario, the `when` expression evaluates to true when the param is intially
loaded and it's state is `null`.

The `then` condition uses the `SpEL` language to set the value of `LocalDate.now()` into `initDateOnLoad`.

CAUTION: The observant will notice that `@ExpressionConditional` is so versatile in that it could be used to perform the 
same logic achieved by several other framework defined _conditional annotations_. Ideally it should not be used when 
another _conditional annotation_ is available to achieve the same behavor.

.Available Param Methods
Given that `@ExpressionConditional` is extremely versatile, misuse of the annotation could result in unexpected
behavior from within the framework. As such, the access to the context param in the `then` condition has been 
restricted to provide access to a subset of it's methods.

The methods available to be used can be identified by reviewing `EntityStateHolder`.
